Remember, building a regular running habit is a significant journey, and every step counts, even if it feels slow right now.\n\nLooking back over the past month, it seems like you've only logged one run. While that might feel discouraging, it's also an important opportunity to reassess your running routine. Consistency is key, and even small, regular efforts can lead to big improvements over time. Think about what might have held you back from running more often—was it time, motivation, or something else?\n\nTo get back on track, consider setting a goal to run at least two to three times a week. Start with shorter distances to ease into a routine, aiming for about 20-30 minutes each session. This gradual approach can help you build stamina and make running a regular part of your life.\n\nAdditionally, try joining a local running group or finding a running buddy. Having a community can provide support and motivation, making those runs more enjoyable. Lastly, reflect on your running goals—what does success look like for you beyond just the marathon time? Celebrating small milestones can help keep your spirits high.\n\nYou've got this! Every step you take is a step closer to your goal."
